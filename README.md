# Movie-Recommndation-System

During the recent years with the rise of online services for different purposes, like shopping and entertainment, recommender systems have become ubiquitous. They are being deployed by almost all the players in the online industry. Recommendation systems are algorithms that are designed to suggest related items to the users by leveraging various machine learning models. 

Recommendation system helps users find compelling data in a large corpora which otherwise would be hard to engage the user. For instance, YouTube has billions of videos and more videos are added each day; recommendation systems help in displaying a subset from the large content of videos based on viewing history and demographic information. It is quoted from YouTube that 60% of watch time on their platform comes from recommendations. There are a lot of explicit and implicit parameters that determine the similarities in the items and users. By making use of these parameters, we discuss in this project how to design a recommendation system.

The project focuses on a movie recommendation system based on the data provided by MovieLens database and TMDB database. We have used a dataset suitable for educational purposes.  The MovieLens database contains a dataset of 100,000 ratings (0-5 scale) by 600 unique users on 9,000 movies.  It also contains a dataset of 3,600 user generated tag/keywords applied to those 9,000 movies.  The database also contains metadata (genre, cast, etc.) for each movie.  The TMDB dataset contains metadata as well as plot overviews for 5,000 movies. 

Recommender systems are typically broken down into three types, content filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid (a mix of the two).  Our project aims to outline several methods of designing recommender systems within each type.  We identify the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches and ultimately offer a recommendation on the best approach for creating a movie recommender.
